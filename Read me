OK folks, in order to compile this the first thing download everything.

2 years since last updated...lots has changed. If you're reading this, you poor fool, 
I will endeavor shortly to upload a new improved version of this basic and shoddy attempt.


Next, rename the MainformDFM file to the rectmove.dfm This is just the object view of the rectmove.pas form.

Thanks
